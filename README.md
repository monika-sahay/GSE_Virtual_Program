# Password Database Analysis and Security Enhancement Project

This project is part of Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience and involves the analysis of a leaked password database to understand security vulnerabilities and propose improvements to controls and policies. The primary objectives include cracking leaked passwords, analyzing the results, and suggesting enhancements to password-related rules and procedures.

## Project Overview

1. **Crack Leaked Password Database:**
   - Utilize various techniques to crack passwords from the leaked database.
   - Investigate hashing algorithms and methods used to protect passwords.
   - Implement password-cracking techniques and tools to uncover weak passwords.

2. **Analyze Results:**
   - Analyze the cracked passwords to identify common patterns, trends, and weaknesses.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of current password policies and controls.
   - Determine the types of passwords most susceptible to cracking.

3. **Propose Uplifts to Controls and Policies:**
   - Based on the analysis, propose improvements to password-related controls.
   - Suggest enhancements to the organization's password policies.
   - Highlight best practices for password security and protection.
